Notes for possible changes in Vers. 2. The next version will likely be published after launch/any FAQs or updates early in the Edition-launch-period.

1. Change wording on hatchway fight to clarify that it can't happen if in control range of enemies **on the same side of the door as the active operative**. i.e. that you can be within 1" of the operatives on the other side of the hatch.

2. Expand Climb slightly to explain how to calculate your climb movement.
