I've added an alternative version here with more "extra" info and I might do one that's even more stripped down vs the original later. Open to feedback on what people prefer. My intention is not to have this replace the core Cheat Sheet but need further testing to see what is actually useful.

# Not sure this will be actively maintained compared to the regular sheet but I wanted to give PvE a try and wanted a simple way to track NPOs.
