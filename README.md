# KT24CheatSheet

A Cheat Sheet for the basic rules of Kill Team 2024 focused on the core PvP gameplay loop (I may create a PvE copy if the game style becomes popular). **If you would like to see a change please open an [Issue in the Issues tab](https://github.com/krones9000/KT24CheatSheet/issues).**

### This Cheat Sheet was built with help from the [/r/KillTeam Community](https://www.reddit.com/r/killteam/). It draws particularly on the content and structure of /u/ChronoDK's original Cheet Sheet. 

I can't promise how regularly I will update this but I will be updating it for my own use so any changes will be updated here too and I will check the Issues for anything I might need to adjust.

#### The Cheat Sheet tries to achieve several things at once (please keep these in mind if suggesting revisions):

* **Everything must fit on a single sheet of A4 paper.** I may add a "tablet" sized version to this repo but it is hard to account for all screen sizes/ratios.
* Sections should be visually clear and arranged in a way that makes sense. Either alphabetized where lists are long **OR** sorted/grouped logically where lists are shorter.
* Each Killzone should be covered as well as any specific nuances when playing there.
* Readers should not have to flip the page over and back regularly. **This is why much of the content is duplicated** on the premise that basics of movement and gameplay loop will become memorized earlier.
* **THIS IS NOT A REPLACEMENT FOR READING THE CORE RULES.** Everything has been simplified and condensed, removing words and changing how things are expressed to save space/time. This should be used to quickly check you're remembering correctly, not as a replacement for actually learning the game.

### A raw .ODG file. 
This file can be opened with [LibreOffice Draw](https://www.libreoffice.org/discover/draw) which is a free editting tool. If you want to change anything you can use this file to adjust the document. Then "Export As" a .PDF

### An A4 formatted .PDF file ready for printing. 
Everything should be sized correctly to fill an A4 page. However, this is untested so... Let me know if there are any issues?
